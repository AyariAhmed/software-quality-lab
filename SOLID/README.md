## Introduction
SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin .

These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.

__SOLID__ stands for:
- `S` - Single-responsiblity Principle
- `O` - Open-closed Principle
- `L` - Liskov Substitution Principle
- `I` - Interface Segregation Principle
- `D` - Dependency Inversion Principle
